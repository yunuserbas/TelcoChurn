# Problem

The client is "Pinky", a telecommunication company that sells telephone and internet packages. Its customers are therefore subscribers and pay monthly. But every month, some customers cancel their subscription, this is called the churn rate. It is a very common indicator in all sectors with subscriptions (telecom, energy, banking, insurance, etc...).

 

Pinky has a call platform with advisors. The advisors can call customers to make commercial proposals. Pinky has noticed that it is almost impossible to get a customer who has cancelled to come back. So he prefers to make sales proposals to "at-risk" customers before they cancel.

That's why Pinky is calling on you! Pinky provides you with extraction from a representative sample of its customer database, including customers who have cancelled this month. Your goal will be to describe the characteristics of the customers who have cancelled and what distinguishes them from other customers. Then you will have to propose a scoring for each customer, in order to prioritize the calls to the most at-risk customers.

# Question

Calculate the attrition rate (number of cancellations / total number of customers), then perform the requested analysis, with explanatory visualizations, and propose a scoring per customer.
